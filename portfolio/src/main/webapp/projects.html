        <h4>Galaga</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <img src="">I replicated the first stage of Galaga to try to get a general idea of how the game works. I am planning to add more to this project in the future.

        <h4>Playlist Extension</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <img src="">I created a playlist extension that was supposed to allow the user to store the playlist's name and url. The user would then be able to access it once
            they click the play button for the respected playlist. The features I intended on adding require me to learn more about web development, so the project is temperarily on halt for now...

        <h4>Physics Solver</h4>
        <blockquote>
            <img src="">I created a program that solves for variables in a physics problem by provided the variables given to you already. The program will then use the variables given and look for
            possible equations to use, which are all stored in a text file in a specific format. Once the equation is found, the variable you are looking for will be outputed.
